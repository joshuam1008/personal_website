I wanted this rebuild to feel more like a personal studio than a static resume. Astro gives me the right balance:

- **Authoring stays Markdown-first.** I can rough out a post or a project write-up without leaving my editor.
- **Client JavaScript is opt-in.** Most sections render to static HTML, but I can hydrate a React island for more playful interactions.
- **Performance is easy to protect.** Tailwind keeps the styling consistent while Astro handles asset bundling and image optimization.

## Making the hero feel alive

For the landing section I'm sketching out a layered scene:

1. A glassmorphic card that introduces me and links to the essentials (resume, GitHub, writing).
2. A small React island powered by `framer-motion` to animate badges drifting in and a parallax glow.
3. Subtle scroll-triggered reveals using the lightweight `motion` utilities so that the hero text and CTA slide into view.

It's a lot of polish in a small surface area, which is exactly where I want to spend motion budget.

## Structuring content for growth

The new `/src/content` directory handles everything:

- `blog/` for long-form updates like this.
- `projects/` for portfolio entries with metadata, tags, and launch dates.
- `resume/` for timeline data that feeds the experience and education sections.

Collections give me type safety in frontmatter, so a missing field or invalid link shows up instantly during development.

## Next iteration goals

- Compose a project gallery that highlights three flagship builds with animated hover cards.
- Ship the first writing pieces using MDX so I can embed live demos when needed.
- Wire up MiniSearch for client-side search across posts and projects.

Each commit pushes straight to GitHub Pages, so once the hero and lists feel right I can iterate publicly. Astro makes shipping the new version the easy partâ€”the design taste is the real work.
