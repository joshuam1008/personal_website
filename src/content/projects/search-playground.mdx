This project began as an experiment to compare embedding-powered reranking with traditional BM25 search. The Astro site hosts an overview and documentation, while a linked Streamlit app handles the live demos.

## Features

- Dataset switcher with prebuilt JSON indexes to keep the static site light.
- Animated callouts that explain latency vs. relevance trade-offs in less than a minute.
- Notebook-inspired MDX write-up that embeds charts and code snippets alongside narrative.

I plan to integrate the Streamlit deployment more tightly by embedding recorded walkthroughs directly in the Astro project pages.
