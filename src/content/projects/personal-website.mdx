The 2025 refresh focuses on motion-forward storytelling without sacrificing load time. Astro's island architecture keeps most pages static, while targeted React components add polish where it matters.

## Highlights

- Tailwind-powered design system with glassmorphism accents, layered gradients, and dark-first theming.
- Hero section animated with `framer-motion`, including staggered badges and a glowing backdrop that reacts to cursor position.
- Client-side MiniSearch index so visitors can filter posts and projects instantly.
- GitHub Actions pipeline that builds on pushes to `main` and publishes straight to GitHub Pages with my custom domain.

## Stack

- Astro 5 + MDX collections for blog posts, projects, and resume timeline data.
- Tailwind CSS + typography plugin for consistent writing and component styling.
- Motion One utilities for scroll reveals, with a React island dedicated to the hero animation.
- Formspree for a zero-backend contact form and Giscus for optional comments on long-form posts.

The result is a résumé website that feels purposeful, handles future content growth, and stays easy to maintain.
